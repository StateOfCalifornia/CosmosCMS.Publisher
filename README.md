Please Note: Each Cosmos CMS website is actually made up of two parts--and two repositories. This repository is for the "Publisher." This application is used to publish web content on the web. The other is the "Editor", and it used to create web pages and other content.

Cosmos CMS (C/CMS) is a ASP.NET Core (v.5) hybrid Web Content Management System (CMS). It is a "hybrid" because of it's extremely open architecture that allows for you to mashup this CMS with your own functionality and integrations.

## Cloud-first Design

C/CMS is built for [the cloud](https://cosmos.azureedge.net/), and makes use of services such as:

* Redis cache
* Content Distribution Networks 
  * Akamai
  * Microsoft
  * Verizon
* Blob storage for assets
* Google Translate (v3)
* OAuth
  * Google
  * Microsoft

C/CMS also takes advantage of the cloud's ability to automatically scale, and, run simultaneously in multiple regions.
